We chose the pre-approved project “Garbage Classification” because we liked the idea of a system that automatically detects and classifies pieces of garbage. We thought of a unique application, for example: Garbage laying on a conveyer belt, and passing through an automatic sorting system. The system would use cameras to detect which locations on the conveyer belt contain the type of garbage. A robotic arm would then be able to sort the system. 

However, this application is better suited for industries. What we hope to accomplish is to build an app, where the user can take a picture of a collection of garbage. A moving window would then capture the locations that contain a specific type of garbage.  

The moving window dimensions would have to be of a specific dimension (hyperparameter), to optimize the classification accuracy. The pixels of the fixed windows would then be merged to create a patch of a specific garbage type. This way, we can calculate how much percent the image contains of a garbage class by calculating patch_pixels/image_pixels*100.
